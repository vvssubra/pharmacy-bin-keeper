## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: English UI first — ensures all subsequent phases ship with correct labels; avoids late Malay-string cleanup pass
- [Roadmap]: Drug sync before PDF — 3-6 line fix with highest clinical value; no deployment risk
- [Roadmap]: User management last — only feature requiring new infrastructure (Edge Function); highest security risk
- [Roadmap]: Service role key must never appear in browser bundle or VITE_ env vars — use Edge Function as proxy

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Edge Function local testing requires `supabase start` — verify local dev stack is initialised before Phase 4 planning
- [Phase 4]: `get_all_users_with_roles()` RPC has no pagination — acceptable for now; revisit if user list grows
- [Phase 3]: `@react-pdf/renderer` has known Vite compatibility quirks — verify `optimizeDeps` config in dev build before production
